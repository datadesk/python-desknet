### Installation

```python
pip install python-desknet
```

## Basic usage

Importing the library

```python
from desknet import DeskNet
```

Creating a new client that can talk to the API

```python
client = DeskNet("your_client_name", "your_client_secret")
```

Create a new element by submitting keyword arguments that correspond [what's supported by DeskNet](http://api.desk-net.com/#api-Element-CreateElement). There is no cleaning or preprocessing. DeskNet has to like what you submit. A dictionary is returned with what was saved to the site, including a unique identifier.

```python
element = client.create(title='This is my budget item')
```
